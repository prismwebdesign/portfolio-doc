February 2016 | Web Development

My client brought me on to strategize creative ways to deliver difficult-to-proxy content. The client also put me on the PHP development team. Other responsibilities included front-end development, creating regular expression based content filters, and supporting a python library used in the project.

"Ben has been an amazing find! He operates at the highest level of professionalism, is very responsive, communicates clearly and takes initiative to understand and complete complex tasks. Ben integrated seamlessly with our dev team and within a short time was accelerating the development of complex features for a startup product based on the Symfony II framework. It's been a pleasure working with Ben and we'll continue to work with him in the future. From myself and the team we highly recommend Ben's work. Thanks Ben!"

# Connect With Christ

My client needed a church directory site for a new outreach initiative to reach the communities local to each church. As part of this hyper-local effort, we developed a location-guided map page that directed the website visitor to a church page with media produced in their local church. Besides developing the front-end, we built a complete administrator dashboard to allow the management of church listings and their respective media.
